# 📌 Project Overview

This repository presents an **end-to-end Stock Market Time Series Forecasting project** completed as part of an **IIT-certified Data Science & Analytics Program**.

The objective of this project is to analyze historical stock market data of selected **NSE-listed companies**, forecast future stock prices using statistical and machine learning time series models, and construct a data-driven investment portfolio.

The project covers the complete analytics workflow—from data collection and preprocessing to forecasting, portfolio allocation, and performance evaluation using the **StockGro virtual trading platform**.

# 🤖 Forecasting Models

### Facebook Prophet

Used for forecasting stock prices while capturing:

- Trend
- Seasonality
- Holiday effects
- Future predictions

---

### ARIMA

Applied for statistical forecasting after making the series stationary using differencing.

---

# 📉 Model Evaluation Metrics

The forecasting models were evaluated using:

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Actual vs Predicted Comparison

---

# 💼 Portfolio Analysis

Based on the forecasting results, a diversified stock portfolio was constructed considering:

- Forecasted returns
- Historical volatility
- Risk diversification

The investment strategy was then tested on the **StockGro Virtual Trading Platform** to compare forecasted performance with actual market outcomes.
